## Prettier for PHP

Prettier https://prettier.io/blog/2018/04/09/plugin-php-0.1.html could be alternative to php code_sniffer https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer.

Prettier can be use with:
* javascript
* jsx
* angular
* vue
* flow
* typescript
* css, less, and scss
* html
* json
* graphQL
* markdown
* YAML 

By far the biggest reason for adopting Prettier is to stop all the on-going debates over styles. It is generally accepted that having a common style guide is valuable for a project and team. https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/10/why-coding-style-matters/
